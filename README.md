## About Event Organizer Marketplace

Event Organizer Marketplace (EOM) is a project for ISYS6169 - Database Systems class.

This is one of the projects we did (3rd semester) for ISYS6169 - Database Systems with my team.

We developed a website to connect Event vendor and their customers, complete with user auth (using 2 auth guard for user/ customer and vendor). The website is also responsive, which supports mobile device screens.

The website used Laravel, Bootstrap, jQuery, and MySQL for development. We also used a style template from Colorlib to speed up the process. The style template was converted to comply with Laravel blade templating.
